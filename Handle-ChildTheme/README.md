### Child theme

If you will be using ACF with your child theme uncomment the [following](https://github.com/adampatterson/Handle/blob/master/functions.php#L13) so that ACF will store the `.json` files in your working Child theme.

Opening `theme-helpers.php` and uncommenting the function on [line 6](https://github.com/adampatterson/Handle/blob/master/lib/theme-helpers.php#L6) would allows the child theme to serve all of your themes assets.
